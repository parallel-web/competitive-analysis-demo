Ok. Yeah for this to become high quality:

- Split up: task per competitor.
- SSE (especially useful for seeing which mcps were used and how that went)
- Taxonomy and company list with most famous internet startups
- Interlinking between companies. If they don't exist yet, create on demand
- Another thing to make it look much nicer, is adding icons for each company.
- Also, validate and remove non-existing companies or have a way to filter out bad results, not making them public
- A way to potentially refresh or remove older entries
- Figure out what to do with 'low confidence' outputs. Can we just hide it and assume the data is correct? A lot of fields have low confidence
- The OAuth I'm using doesn't work on subpath so will need tweaking to make it work on oss.parallel.ai/competitors (unless we go for another domain)
- OAuth should have dialog saying what they're logging in for (to use MCP on their behalf, get 5 searches for free, get their profile info)
- Parallel branding
